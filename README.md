One of the vehicle insurance companies wants to increase the number of people having cars or motorbikes to use their company's vehicle insurances. They want to do so by providing customized offers and promotions to the people of Munich having cars. They have a tie-up with automotive manufacturers, petroleum stations, car/motor-bike repair shops, etc and also have contact with many common app owners.

The vehicle insurance company can know when people are near the venues like automotive repair shops, gas/petroleum stations, etc, and wanted to send customized offers/promotions when people are near the venues where they have a tie-up with.
Now they want to segregate the people having similar characteristics into clusters so that they can send customized offers/promotions to increase their insurances count thereby increasing their revenue.


we will help the insurance company by analyzing the number_of_venues they have a tie-up within each region, number of working professionals, number of new cars registered in each region of Munich in a year to segment the whole Munich region into different segments.
